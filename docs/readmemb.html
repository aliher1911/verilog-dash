    <br/>
    Read contents of a file with binary data representation into memory array. Data could contain whitespaces, verilog comments, addresses and binary data.
    <br/><br/>
    Data words should match memory words in width.
    <br/><br/>
    Address is always in hexadecimal form and prefixed with @ symbol.
    <br/><br/>
    Reading will begin at 0 or startAddr if provided. If address of next word to write falls out of range, reading stops. If address is found in file, it will change address where next word would be read. If this address is out of range, reading stops as well, ignoring remainder of the file. If address ranges overlap, later values will overwrite earlier ones.
